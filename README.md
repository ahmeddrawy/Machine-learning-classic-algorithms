# Machine learning training models
This is our implementation to various machine learning algorithms taken in Machine learning course

1. Decision Trees
2. SVM
3. Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression


### description
1. Linear regression 
* using linear regression to predict the price of house based on features in it

2. Logistic regression
* used to classify if patient have heart disease or not

## main classes
- Dataset class - used to normalize data, and abstract data
- Gradient Descent class - used to apply gradient descent algorithm to data providing the hypothesis function used, cost function, derivitative function and rate of work
- heart_conf -configuration for heart model including it's path, rate of work, features columns, label columns, number of iterations, hypothesis function, cost function and derivative function
- house_conf -configuration for house pricing model including it's path, rate of work, features columns, label columns, number of iterations, hypothesis function, cost function and derivative function
